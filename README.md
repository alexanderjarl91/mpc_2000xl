<b>A tribute to the Akai MPC2000xl sampler</b>

This page features a javascript application replica of the Akai MPC 2000xl sampler. It features 16 different pads, all with different sounds, playable with a mouseclick
or via the keyboard keybindings. Page is mobile responsive (with minor issues).

HTML5, CSS and Javascript ES6.

ES6:
This web app uses ES6 features like let/const variables, arrow functions and forEach.

DOM Manipulation:
This web app uses javascript DOM manipulation. Alot of DOM elements are manipulated in some way; hide them, showsthem, play them for example. Some elements are animated to appear and move. The app also contains event listeners like load, click and keydown. It also iterates through DOM collections and makes an array out of them, like the sounds array. There are also alot timing events.

It doesnt contain the project requirement of a loading screen, clock or option to go back as I did not see it fit well with my idea.
